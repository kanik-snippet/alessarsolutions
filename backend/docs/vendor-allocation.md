# Supplier, client, API and CPI operations

This feature is additive and is now part of the main application. Vendor allocation is enforced in project listing, copied-link validation, respondent initiation, callback finalization and legacy callback reconciliation.

## Account rules

- `EmployeeProfile.account_type` remains the source of truth for employee, internal-vendor and external-vendor identity.
- Only an account with `vendors.manage` may create vendor accounts.
- Every internal vendor is assigned the system `Admin` role automatically. With `respondents.create` it may create employee/respondent children only.
- Every external vendor is assigned the safe system `External Vendor` role automatically. It can receive individual allow/deny overrides for permitted business functions.
- An external vendor is always terminal and cannot create users or roles, even if an Admin role or management allow-override is assigned accidentally. Identity, role, client, allocation and synchronization management functions are removed at permission evaluation time as a second line of defense.
- External vendors are independent terminal accounts. They never belong to the internal organization hierarchy.

## Internal organization hierarchy

Internal operations use real relational units rather than profile text fields:

1. a super-admin office or internal vendor owns one or more `OrganizationUnit` Branch rows;
2. every Sub-branch belongs to exactly one Branch;
3. every Shift belongs to exactly one Sub-branch; and
4. Team Leads and Employees are assigned to a Shift through `EmployeeProfile.organization_unit`.

Multiple Team Leads may share a Shift. Each Team Lead can see lower-rank employee Studies and User Hits in that Shift. A Manager or Admin assigned higher in the tree sees lower-rank activity in descendant units. Internal-vendor roots can manage and audit their full organization tree. Existing unassigned profiles remain valid for backward compatibility.

Organization structure totals roll upward without copying access rows: a Shift's members and unique client grants are included in its Sub-branch and Branch totals. This keeps management summaries accurate while preventing a client assigned to one Shift from leaking into sibling Shifts.

`OrganizationClientAccess` assigns clients to any unit using nearest-level precedence. Direct Shift grants form that Shift's complete client set and override broader Sub-branch or Branch grants. A Shift without direct grants inherits the closest configured Sub-branch, then Branch; a configured Sub-branch likewise overrides its Branch. Main-office grants may use any active client. Internal-vendor grants must also exist in that vendor's active `VendorClientAllocation`; the unit rule can narrow vendor visibility but can never expand beyond owner-controlled allocations. Project listing, detail access and manually punched respondent links enforce the same client scope.

## Data hierarchy

1. `Client` identifies a buyer/source account.
2. `ClientIntegration` stores non-secret upstream connection metadata. It stores the environment-variable name for a credential, never the token.
3. `VendorCommercialProfile` stores a vendor's default CPI cut, currency and delivery mode (`panel`, `api` or `both`). Internal vendors are always panel-only with zero cut.
4. `VendorClientAllocation` assigns a client and automatically includes all of its current and future live projects.
5. `VendorSurveyAllocation` is an optional project rule. An inactive rule excludes that project; an active rule may override its CPI cut or active window.
6. `AllocationReservation` is an allocation audit row for one survey attempt. Local supplier quantity caps are not enforced; upstream survey availability remains authoritative.

## CPI precedence and snapshot

For external vendors, cut precedence is survey override, client override, then vendor default. Internal vendors always receive a zero-percent cut. External-vendor project and tracking APIs do not expose source CPI; they return payable CPI and the applied cut. On reservation, `SurveyAttempt` freezes:

- vendor and client;
- client and survey allocation IDs;
- source CPI;
- applied cut percentage;
- payable CPI; and
- currency.

Changing the live survey CPI later cannot change an existing attempt snapshot.

Each new attempt resolves the current source CPI and current survey/client/vendor cut again. Consequently, a completed attempt at CPI 3 remains CPI 3 after an update, while later attempts use the newly published CPI and current configured cut.

## External delivery channels

An external vendor can be configured as Panel only, API only, or Panel + API. API-only vendors cannot establish or retain a browser session. Panel-only vendors cannot receive or use API keys.

Owner workspace users issue revocable keys from Vendor Management. A plaintext key is displayed exactly once; the database stores only an HMAC-SHA256 digest plus a masked prefix/suffix. Send the key as either:

```http
X-API-Key: exh_...
```

or:

```http
Authorization: Api-Key exh_...
```

The key authenticates as its external vendor. Every request applies its current function permissions, selected active client grants, project exclusions and per-client/project CPI cut. The default feed exposes the Alessar Project ID as `source_id`; each key can instead expose the upstream survey ID. `/api/v1/surveys/?client_name=ABC` filters the allocated client label.

Each key can hold four supplier outcome URLs (completed, terminated, quota full and quality terminated). External start links contain a `{supplier_uid}` placeholder. The final supplier redirect includes `status`, `supplier_uid`, `project_id`, `survey_id`, Alessar `rid`, `term_reason` and `term_category`.

Optional supplier hash verification is disabled by default. When enabled, a separate `vrh_...` hash is displayed once and the start-link template also contains `{hash_key}`. Missing or incorrect hashes are rejected before an attempt is created. The database stores only its HMAC digest and masked identifier.

## Allocation audit lifecycle

Initiation freezes the effective client/project/CPI context and creates one audit row. Status `1` finalizes it as consumed; statuses `2`, `3` and `4` finalize it as released. Abandoned rows expire through the existing cleanup task. Finalization is idempotent and does not maintain supplier quantity counters.

## UAT API

All endpoints require function permissions and are documented in Swagger:

- `/api/v1/vendors/clients/`
- `/api/v1/vendors/integrations/`
- `/api/v1/vendors/commercial-profiles/`
- `/api/v1/vendors/api-keys/` (issue, configure ID mode/hash/redirects, list masked metadata and revoke)
- `/api/v1/vendors/client-allocations/`
- `/api/v1/vendors/survey-allocations/`
- `/api/v1/vendors/reservations/` (read-only audit)
- `/api/v1/vendors/directory/` (vendor policy directory)
- `/api/v1/vendors/management-options/` (non-secret vendor/client selector data)
- `/api/v1/vendors/organization-units/` (Branch, Sub-branch and Shift CRUD)
- `/api/v1/vendors/organization-client-access/` (unit client visibility CRUD)
- `/api/v1/vendors/organization-options/` (scoped owner/client selector data)

The responsive `/vendors/` workspace uses separate modals for commercial policy, client allocation, project exclusion and API-key/redirect operations. `/organization/` manages Branch, Sub-branch, Shift and inherited client routing without horizontal page overflow. User creation stays in the Access Control modal and selects a real organization unit, so account type, role, hierarchy and function-level allow/deny overrides have one source of truth.

Super admins and non-vendor management accounts see the full authorized dataset. Vendor accounts and respondents below an internal vendor are restricted to that vendor's allocations. Commercial policies, exclusions and API keys remain owner-controlled and read-only for vendor-scoped accounts, even if a manage permission is assigned accidentally.

The first migrations map existing `company_name=InnovateMR` surveys to a seeded InnovateMR client without changing survey IDs, source CPI or respondent flow. Every later InnovateMR inventory sync applies the same client mapping, and its closed-survey pass cannot close inventory belonging to a future provider.
